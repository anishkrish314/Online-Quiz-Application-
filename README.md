## Online Quiz Web App

### Project Overview
The project is an interactive General Knowledge Quiz that has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to answer multiple-choice questions under a time constraint, and upon the end of the game, will present the user with their final score and tally, as well provide instant feedback for each question, as well as provide a modern look and feel to the app.

*Note: The quiz currently has a limited amount of sample questions for demo purposes.
